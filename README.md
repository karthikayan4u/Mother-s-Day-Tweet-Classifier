# Mother-s-Day-Tweet-Classifier
While every day should be Mothers Day, we are all guilty of taking to social media to post mushy messages or images on the second Sunday of May for our mothers. However, the Human Resources team of your organization wishes to celebrate and honor all moms currently employed at the company with a special monthly event. For one of such events, they have reached out to your team to curate and categorize Mothersâ€™ Day-related tweets from across the globe.  As a Machine Learning Engineer, your task is to build a sophisticated sentiment analysis-based NLP model that can classify sentiments of tweets into positive, negative, and neutral.
